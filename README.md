# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Helix editor, tmux and Starship prompt.

## Requirements

Ubuntu Linux with bash shell.

## Installation

Get the repo with `git clone https://github.com/franFodor/dotfiles`.

Run using `./install.sh`. You might need to make it an executable suing `chmod +x install.sh`.

**You will need to install tmux plugins after you run the script, it can be done using `C-b I` in tmux!**
